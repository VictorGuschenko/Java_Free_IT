Motherfucker empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on.
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, shit another mindless crime dick.
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime.
Hold the  fucking shit line,
Does anybody bitch want to take it anymore?

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance.
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on,
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning bitch.
I must be warmer BITCH now.
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now.
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.
